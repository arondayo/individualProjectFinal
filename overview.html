        <h2>My journey (idk sounds cheesy)</h2>
        <p>
          My journey with rubik's cubes started when I got my first rubik's cube for my birthday. <br>
          I was still in middle school at the time and I messed around with it pretending to scramble it and undoing the moves pretending to solve it. <br>
          Then it sat on a shelf collecting dust for a while. <br>
          Then one day I picked it up again and pretended to solve it, but I messed up. <br>
          Now I had a scrambled cube and was panicing. <br>
          I thought about peeling the stickers off like I'd heard other people do but I decided that was too much of a copout. <br>
          So I went on youtube and searched up a way to solve it. <br>
          The tutorials I found went way over my head, it had notation I didn't understand and long algorithms that looked like gibberish. <br>
          But I also discoverd you could just disassemble the cube and reassemble it in a solved state. <br>
          For a while this was the only way I knew how to get my cube back into a solved state. <br>
          I eventually got tired of doing this and got curious on how do people acutally solve this thing. <br>
          I went back on the internet again and I found that the official Rubik's brand website had a tutorial and I decieded to give it a go again. <br>
          It had helpful pictures and diagrams to help me learn the cube notation and had step by step pictures for each move of the algorithms. <br>
          It took a couple days and plenty of frustration but I eventually, finally, solved the cube. <br>
          Fast forward a few years after learning improved solving methods and lots of new algorithms, I'd gotten my solve time down to below a minute. <br>
          At present if I really focus up after some warming up I can pretty easily get below 45-50 seconds.
